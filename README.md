# Automatically booking evaluation slots  
  
I have developed a program that automates  
the process of booking evaluation slots,  
eliminating the need to manually refresh the evaluation page.  
  
Allow me to guide you on its usage:  
  
1.Start by logging in with your credentials (ID and password).  
2.Rest assured that your password remains confidential.  
3.Specify the project name that you wish to have evaluated.  
4.Enter '0' for today or '1' for tomorrow.  
5.Provide the desired start and end times for the evaluation.
